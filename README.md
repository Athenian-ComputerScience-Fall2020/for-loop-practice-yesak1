# For loop practice

## Problem Description
In this repository, you will write two programs (as prompted in the Edpuzzle video.) Note that there are two python files: countdown.py and divisibility_check.py.

* Your countdown program should print a countdown from 20 to 10. (More advanced students, you are welcome to get fancy and import a timer if that interests you.)
* Your divisibility checker should check the numbers from 2 through 50 (inclusive) to see if they are divisible by 3.  If the number is divisible by three, print a message that says, "x is divisible by three" where x is the number being tested.  If it is not divisible by 3 print a message to that effect as well.


## Hints
* Pay attention to the counters in your for loops - they are useful!
* Review the % (modulus) operator - check out the Intro Python notes in your OneNote notebook.
